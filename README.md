## Nepal Map

NepalMap makes data on Nepal more accessible and understandable.
NepalMap is of great use to journalists, students, academics and others who are interested in using data to learn about Nepal. This tool is a friendly and reliable resource for journalists who want to use data to tell stories or discover stories that are of public interest.
NepalMap uses the National Data Profile, created by the Central Bureau of Statistics, and other official sources, to create user-friendly data visualizations on key demographic issues. You can embed, access or download the data too. You can also compare any two areas side-by-side.
If you would like to access pre-federal data from the 2011 Population Census, please check out: 2011.nepalmap.org.
NepalMap is a project of Code for Nepal, a non-profit that works to increase digital literacy and the use of open data in Nepal. Please make a tax deductible donation to help us maintain the server space for NepalMap, and empower Nepal digitally!
