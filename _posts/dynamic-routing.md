NepalMap makes data on Nepal more accessible and understandable.
NepalMap is of great use to journalists, students, academics and
others who are interested in using data to learn about Nepal. This
tool is a friendly and reliable resource for journalists who want to
use data to tell stories or discover stories that are of public
interest.

NepalMap uses the National Data Profile, created by the
Central Bureau of Statistics, and other official sources, to create
user-friendly data visualizations on key demographic issues. You can
embed, access or download the data too. You can also compare any two
areas side-by-side. If you would like to access pre-federal data
from 2011 Population Census, please check out: 2011.nepalmap.org.

NepalMap is a project of Code for Nepal, a non-profit that works to
increase digital literacy and the use of open data in Nepal. Please
make a tax deductible donation to help us maintain the server space
for NepalMap, and empower Nepal digitally! Shoulders of Giants Yes!
NepalMap is based on Wazimap which is a fork of Census Reporter.
Wazimap is built and maintained by Code for South Africa. Other
implementations include Wazimap Kenya and Wazimap South Africa, the
first Wazimap implementation.

All of these tools are completely open
source. You can build one for your country. NepalMap code is

NepalMap is entirely built by volunteers who are committed to
ensuring everyone has access to open data about Nepal. We need more
